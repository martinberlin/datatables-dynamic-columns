# Datatables with dynamic columns

A solution to add dynamic headers to datatables jQuery plugin.
This public repository will help to post solutions and code-snippets we find useful, please feel free to fork and add your own commentaries and examples.
Resume:

  - dynamic-headers.html  loads json from data/data.json 
    The idea is that in the JSON we define the columns, adding a **name** additional attribute that defines the Title of the table header
    Any other render or transformation applied to the column should be defined in the Javascript code (see example)

## Test notes:

datatables js and css is included for demo purposes. Please download latest version of datatables here:
[https://datatables.net/download](https://datatables.net/download)

## Exceptions

Using this dynamic generation of Columns won't play well with:

     "serverSide": true
     
 Since we are “fabricating” the table ourselves. Other than that so far everything else works just as a normal dataTable.
